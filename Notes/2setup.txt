features = products(MFE1) & cart(MFE2)
container (MFE3)
features will be created using html,css,js

setup for MFE1 (products) - 
1) Go to folder and > npm init -y
2) npm install faker@5.1.0 html-webpack-plugin@4.5.0 nodemon webpack@5.3.2 webpack-cli@4.1.0 webpack-dev-server@3.11.0
3) In js file it doesnt know import statement.
4) create webpack.config.js file (copy content)
5) inside package.json Go to Scripts - "start": "webpack"
6) This webpack will bundle our code into a single file along with dependencies.
7) add this devServer: {port: 8081,} to webpack.config.json and "start": "webpack serve" in package.json 
8) Now when u to npm start our project runs on 8081
9) Go to chrome localhost:80801/main.js -> you will see our bundled main.js file.
10) To run our application in browser we need index.html page inside which our script tag will contain bundle.js.
11) when we have multiple random js files generated from our webpack we need to include all those in html doc. 
        how to do it?
            - html-webpack-plugin we use this when ever webpack generates some file it will be automatically included in html page by this plugin.
            - add configuration changes to webpack.config.js
12) Now go to chrome and type localhost:8081 then u can see your application running.
13) Now when every you make changes and save then it will automatically compile and updates bundle.js and added to index.html internally.

Thats it now you have build your own MFE which runs on its own.
